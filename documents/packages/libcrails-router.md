Provides a template class for building _URL mapping_ through a _routing_ system, with our own custom URL parameter and callback types.

See the [Crails::RouterBase] template documentation for more details.

There are two examples of implementations:

- [Crails::Router], the router for the backend framework (Crails)
- [Comet::Router], the router for the frontend framework (Comet)

<p>Writes a file if needed, and returns sucess status. Arguments are: <code>task_name</code>, an identifier for the process that's writing the file, a <code>path</code> defining where to write the file, and <code>contents</code> for the expected contents of the file.</p>
<p>Will recursively create the parent directories if needed.</p>
<p>If a file already exist at the given path, will first read the existing file. The file will only be overwritten if the content found differs from the expected contents.</p>
<p>This is useful when generating C++ files, to avoid needlessly re-compiling the same code after using a code generator.</p>

<p>Use this method to force the client's browser to send an <code>Authentication</code> user. The expected client's credentials (user and password) are specified in the two parameters of the function.</p>
<p>Instead of directly specyfing a user and a password, you can also send a callback in the form of [std::function&lt;bool(const std::string&amp;,const std::string&amp;)&gt;]: the callback receive the user and password sent by the client, and it is expected to return <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> depending on whether the authentication is successful or not.</p>
<p>In case of failure, the <code>require_basic_authentication</code> method sets directly sends a response to the client (using either the <em>Unauthorized</em> or <em>Unprocessable entity</em> status), meaning you do not have to set a response status yourself. You may still provide a body for the response.</p>

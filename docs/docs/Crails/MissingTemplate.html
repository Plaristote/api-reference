<p>Exception thrown when a <a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-sm btn-cpptype" data-cpptype="::Crails::Renderer" href="#/classes/::Crails::Renderer" target="_self">Renderer</a> was requested to render a <a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-sm btn-cpptype" data-cpptype="::Crails::Template" href="#/classes/::Crails::Template" target="_self">Template</a> that does not exist.</p>
<p>Be mindful that a template isn't merely defined by its name, but also by the format it may answer to: this exception will be thrown both if no template with an adequate name was found, or if none of the renderers containing such a template support the format requested by the client in the <code>Accept</code> header.</p>
